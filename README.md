# blnb

*This project is in its beginning stages and is non-functional.*

A fully featured CLI notebook written in Scala!

## About

This is meant to be the full-sized companion to blnote, which is a node-based CLI notebook app. While you can technically write and store full sized notes with that app, that really isn't what it's meant for.

As I've already alluded to, quite a bit of functionality will overlap between the two projects. However, I want this one to feel more like a traditional notebook app, where you can create, edit, delete, etc. multiple full-sized notebooks and keep them organized with names, titles, tags, etc.

Is one project necessarily better than the other? No, not really. They serve slightly different purposes, so you can pick whichever you would rather use in any given situation. You could also choose to use both or neither; it's up to you.
